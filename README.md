# ⚡ DevPulse Automation Test

## 📄 Project Description
This is a test repository designed to verify the **DevPulse Sync Engine** workflow.

The goal of this project is to confirm that pushing code to GitHub triggers the configured Webhook, which in turn updates the external Portfolio Dashboard in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
* **Automation:** GitHub Webhooks
* **Middleware:** Python (FastAPI) + Ngrok

## 🚀 How It Works
1.  **Code Commit:** A developer pushes changes to this repository.
2.  **Webhook Trigger:** GitHub sends a `POST` payload to the DevPulse backend.
3.  **Dashboard Update:** The DevPulse console logs the event instantly.
